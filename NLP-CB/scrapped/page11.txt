Leading Bollywood critics and experts help us pick the best mainstream Indian movies
We need to talk about Bollywood. Not as a source of magnificently uplifting movies with great songs and flamboyant costumes â€“ thatâ€™s a given â€“ but as a term. For the purposes of this list weâ€™re using it as a catch-all for the full multitude of Indian film industries. This, we know, will upset purists whoâ€™ll point out â€“ correctly â€“ that it should only be used to refer to the Hindi film industry based in Mumbai. But rightly or wrongly, the term has come to represent Indian cinema more broadly â€“ taking in everything from the Telugu-language films of Hyderabad to the very un-Bollywood work of Kolkata great Satyajit Ray. Itâ€™s an imperfect framework to examine a complex, multilingual film culture, but itâ€™s a great way to introduce a tonne of worthy movies to dive into. Which brings us to our next dilemma, because choosing a definitive â€˜best-ofâ€™ list is an impossible task. Our top 100 is a bulging, wildly varied collection of our favourites: there are rom-coms like Jab We Met, canonical â€˜curry westernsâ€™ like Sholay, eternal romantic touchstones like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, modern classics like Swades and Barfi!, and art-house staples like Ardh Satya and Ankur. Between them all, theyâ€™re proof that Bollywood is both more than, and the epitome of, song-and-dance cinema. And whether youâ€™re looking for musicals, action, comedy or romance, thereâ€™s something here for you.

Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Rishi Kapoor, Dimple Kapadia
Genre: romance
Rich Hindu adolescent lad Raja (Kapoor) falls for Bobby (Kapadia), the 16-year-old granddaughter of his Goan Catholic nanny. When his snobbish parents object to their â€˜friendshipâ€™, the young lovers decide to elope. This landmark film was a resounding success as Indian audiences had rarely ever seen teenage love expressed so sensuously on screen. The lead duo was believable too, and Kapadia became a national sensation with her mini-skirts and halter tops â€“ an exposing bikini sequence was especially eye-grabbing. Laxmikant Pyarelalâ€™s fresh soundtrack added to the appeal of this sweet film, with every song remaining a hit to this day.
The big sceneWhen the top screen villain of the time Prem Chopra makes a cameo as himself.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Sooraj R Barjatya
Cast: Madhuri Dixit, Salman Khan, Tuffy
Genre: musical, romance
This 1990s blockbuster was directly responsible for audiences in India and elsewhere returning to Bollywood after a drastic drop in attendance in the 1980s due to video piracy and disillusionment with the crude action films of that era. Expect 14 songs, two weddings and a cremation. Nothing else really happens, yet its shameless lavish depiction of every celebration of a perfect north Indian family, and especially their elaborate colourful Hindu wedding rituals, sucked audiences into cinemas again and again. â€˜HAHKâ€™, as it is known, is the film which kickstarted the global awareness of modern Bollywood.
The big sceneWhen wonder dog Tuffy has to decide whether to reunite the lovers or not.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Ayan Mukherjee
Cast: Deepika Padukone, Ranbir Kapoor, Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapoor
Genre: romance, comedy
This romantic comedy fits the Bollywood template perfectly: it boasts flamboyant colours, songs and dance and, more importantly, a big fat Indian wedding. It tells of two characters, Bunny (Kapoor) and Naina (Padukone), and their group of friends, who we first meet as they leave university before the film flashes forward to the end of their twenties. What made the film doubly successful was that its two stars were former lovers in real life, lending them a special chemistry onscreen.
The big sceneAfter the big song â€˜Balam Pichkariâ€™, Bunnyâ€™s friends discover a letter congratulating him for landing a job in America. The four friends go their separate ways, leaving Nainaâ€™s love for Bunny unspoken.
Anushka Arora
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherji
Genre: romance
Yash Chopra, Bollywoodâ€™s most successful and respected director, delivers a groundbreaking musical romance on an epic scale. Will the love that Indian Hindu Veer (Khan) and Pakistani Muslim Zaara (Zinta) feel for each other be able to overcome cross-cultural, emotional and physical borders? Chopra employs his trademark â€˜chiffon sari in the Swiss Alpsâ€™ style while including progressive political and social messages about Indo-Pak unity, womenâ€™s rights, inept justice and hope for the future. The late composer Madan Mohan and Lata Mangeshkarâ€™s tunes achieve lyrical perfection. The result is an uplifting, colourful and soulful gem.
The big sceneWhen the lovers reunite in a Pakistani courtroom after being apart for over two decades.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Muzaffar Ali
Cast: Rekha, Farouque Shaikh, Naseeruddin Shah
Genre: drama
This is an adaptation of Mirza Hadi Ruswaâ€™s well-known 1899 novel about a Lucknow courtesan called Umrao Jaan (Rekha) who fights to escape the profession she was kidnapped into by following the path of true love. The carefully crafted period setting captivated viewers and critics on its release, and the story was told again in 2006, this time with Aishwarya Rai in the title role.
The big sceneThe song â€˜Dil cheez kya haiâ€™ sees Rekha, wearing a now-legendary red outfit, dancing with iconic choreography to the music of Khayyam.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Ashutosh Gowariker
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi, Kishori Balal
Genre: drama, romance, musical
In Swades, director Ashutosh Gowariker turned his gaze from pre-Independence India (his previous film was the Oscar-nominated Lagaan) to the present day and served up a movie that took a loving but unflinchingly critical look at â€˜our countryâ€™ (as the title translates). Shah Rukh Khan plays US resident Mohan, who makes a life-altering trip to an Indian village thatâ€™s short of electricity and riven with petty conflicts. As many of us who live in countries other than those of our birth do, he slowly comes to realise the truth of the adage spoken by one of the villagers: â€˜It is the destiny of ice to melt in its own water.â€™
The big scene:Mohan harnesses energy from the local stream by building a small dam for the village. The fruits of his labours are beautifully illustrated when a lightbulb comes on for the first time inside the home of an elderly woman, who simply says: â€˜Electricity!â€™
Sahir Avik Dâ€™souza
Director: Mira Nair
Cast: Shafiq Syed, Raghuvir Yadav, Nana Patekar
Genre: drama
This story of kids living on the streets of Bombay isnâ€™t Bollywood in the traditional sense. Writer-director Mira Nair had lived and studied in the US for several years by the time she returned to India to make her eye-opening drama about a young boy, Krishna (Syed) falling deeper and deeper into trouble in the big city. But this is still one of the most stark, realistic films to emerge from India in recent times. Nair cast real street children, something that Danny Boyle would later do for â€˜Slumdog Millionaireâ€™, and the filmâ€™s strength is that it observes and illuminates but does not judge â€“ weâ€™re given more than enough room to make up our own minds on the issues raised by the film.
The big sceneThe now-famous Irrfan Khan pops up briefly as a professional letter writer.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Zoya Akhtar
Cast: Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Kalki Koechlin, Vijay Raaz, Kubra Sait
Genre: drama, musicalÂ Â 
Like Danny Boyleâ€™s Slumdog Millionaire, this film is set in the vibrant Dharavi slums of Mumbai. Key protagonist Murad Ahmed, played to perfection by Ranveer Singh, goes on an Eminem, 8 Mile-style journey, honing his craft with Shrikant â€˜MC Sherâ€™ Bhosle (Siddhant Chaturvedi) and Shweta â€˜Skyâ€™ Mehta (Kalki Koechlin) as supporters, while tending to his overprotective, doctor-to-be girlfriend, Safeena Firdausi (Alia Bhatt). Performing in a concert to impress rapper Nas becomes Muradâ€™s goal. We follow the twists and turns of how his aims to turn his musical dreams into a reality, battling more than just words, but people, staid office jobs and social conventionsÂ that stand in his way.
The big sceneOne of Indiaâ€™s top rappers Emiway Bantai performs, and then the original â€˜Gully Boyâ€™ rapper Divine, invites Murad on stage. The crowd chants his name. He performs the thumping â€˜Apna Time Aayegaâ€™ (My time will come) and delights the audience.Ashanti Omkar
Director: Rajkumar Hirani
Cast: Sanjay Dutt, Vidya Balan, Boman Irani
Genre: comedy, drama, musical
Three years after making his debut with the sleeper hit, â€˜Munna Bhai MBBSâ€™, director Rajkumar Hirani brought back the lovable gangster Munna Bhai (Dutt) â€“ for the best sequel ever made by Bollywood. Munna starts brushing up on his knowledge about Gandhi in order to impress a radio host. Soon, Gandhi materialises before Munna and starts having conversations with him, leading everyone to believe heâ€™s lost his mind. Theatre actor Dilip Prabhavalkar made a rare Hindi film appearance as Gandhi, and nailed a character thatâ€™s always been tough to portray on screen.
The big sceneAn elderly man whoâ€™s been pushed around by a government official for far too long resorts to â€˜Gandhigiriâ€™ (Gandhiism) to achieve his means â€“ he publicly shames the corrupt official by stripping off his clothes.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Govind Nihalani
Cast: Om Puri, Smita Patil, Amrish Puri
Genre: crime, drama
Here, Govind Nihalaniâ€™s trademark â€˜law and orderâ€™ political cinema exposes police brutality in the Bombay force. Anant (Puri) is a no-nonsense cop who is thwarted at every level by the system in his effort to arrest a crooked politician. When he kills a small-time thief, he is forced to seek protection from the same politician he loathes. A surprise hit as it had no major stars or hit songs, â€˜Ardh Satyaâ€™ remains a realistic, caustic comment on the worrying nexus between corrupt politicians and bent cops in India then and now. Om Puriâ€™s explosive performance is enthralling.
The big sceneWhen Anant comes face-to-face with the politician he hates, he has to make a decisionâ€¦
Anil Sinanan
Director: Priyadarshan
Cast: Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal
Genre: comedy, drama, musical
In this popular comedy, a nonsensical plot about a botched kidnapping and phone calls going to the wrong number is balanced by some fine acting from lead actors Kumar, Shetty and Rawal. The latter became an overnight star on the back of â€˜Hera Pheriâ€™ after being on the sidelines as a supporting actor for many years. His portrayal of an alcoholic, naÃ¯ve, half-blind garage owner, who rents his home out to two young boys, brought the house down. The film remains enjoyable even after repeat viewings.
The big sceneWhile demanding a ransom from the rich grandfather of a kidnapped girl, Baburao makes a rough calculation of all his expenses and asks for â€˜paune baraâ€™ (Rs11.75 lakh, or about Â£12,000).
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra
Cast: Farhan Akhtar, Sonam Kapoor
Genre: biopic, drama, sports
Milkha Singh â€“ known as The Flying Sikh â€“ was a world-champion Olympic runner in the 1950s and 1960s, who infamously lost the most important race of his life. â€˜Bhaag Milkha Bhaagâ€™ shows us how he came to be one of Indiaâ€™s greatest runners, and how he overcame the demons of witnessing the massacre of his family during Indiaâ€™s partition. The success of the film comes from its strong attention to detail, a superb performance from Farhan Akhtar as Singh and an inspiring story.
The big sceneWhen amateur runner Milkha is stripped for trying on the â€˜Indiaâ€™ jacket only worn by champions and goes on to beat the bully in a race.
Shai Hussain
Director: Kiran Rao
Cast: Aamir Khan, Monica Dogra, Prateik Babbar
Genre: romance, drama, musical
Kiran Rao broke into filmmaking with this film about five characters, the fifth being the city of Mumbai (the title translates as â€˜Mumbai Diariesâ€™). Arun (Khan) is a reclusive painter who moves into a new apartment and finds video diaries left by the previous tenant, Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra). Shai (Dogra) is a photographer who befriends Munna (Babbar), a slum boy who hopes to break into Bollywood. Tushar Kanti Rayâ€™s cinematography and Gustavo Santaolallaâ€™s background score both beautifully complement this story about different classes of people co-existing in Mumbai.
The big sceneWhile Shai takes pictures in the middle of the night, she spots Munna, who moonlights as a rat killer. Embarrassed about being found out by Shai, Munna flees.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Shakti Samanta
Cast: Rajesh Khanna, Asha Parekh, Prem Chopra
Genre: romance, musical, drama
Inspired by the Hollywood weepie â€˜No Man of Her Ownâ€™ (1950), Shakti Samantaâ€™s film addresses the still-taboo theme of widows remarrying. The film goes out of its way to proclaim the untainted virgin status of its female lead, as Madhu (Parekh) only pretends to be a widow in order to assume a new identity. Complications follow when she is attracted to her â€˜deadâ€™ husbandâ€™s best mate (Khanna). The real superstar of this melodramatic film is RD Burmanâ€™s classic score: every track remains popular to this day.
The big sceneThe first 15 minutes include an escape from an arranged marriage, a romantic betrayal, a death, a reunion and a fatal train crash.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Anurag Kashyap
Cast: Aditya Srivastava, Kay Kay Menon, Pavan Malhotra
Genre: drama, thriller
Long before director Anurag Kashyap broke on to the international scene with films like 2012â€™s â€˜Gangs of Wasseypurâ€™, he struggled to release this controversial real-life drama about the infamous 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai â€“ arguably his best film to date. Kashyap stuck to investigative journalist Hussain Zaidiâ€™s version of the planning, execution and aftermath of the explosions and extracted great performances from his ensemble cast. â€˜Black Fridayâ€™ is a rare thing: an engaging Hindi film based on a true story.
The big sceneKashyap shot one of the best chase sequences on film when a suspect runs from policemen in the Dharavi slum. The six-minute scene is said to have inspired Danny Boyle when he made â€˜Slumdog Millionaireâ€™.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Anurag Kashyap
Cast: Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadda
Genre: action, thriller
Anurag Kashyap is Hindi cinemaâ€™s Quentin Tarantino, and this is his â€˜Reservoir Dogsâ€™, a bloody, brutal and visually arresting gangster film which centres on feuding families and a coal-mining racket. Menacing mafia don Sardar Khan (Bajpai), and his Bollywood-loving, stoner son Faizal (Siddiqui), are both compelling screen presences. Kashyap rips to shreds Bollywoodâ€™s tradition of shooting airbrushed heroes and heroines in pristine locations. Instead this oozes blood and black humour. Kashyap made â€˜Part Twoâ€™ at the same time.
The big sceneSardar Khanâ€™s pregnant, no-nonsense wife Nagma (Chadda) discovers him in a brothel and pulls out a knife â€“ the sight of the terrifying hard man cowering and fleeing is gold.
Rahul Verma
Director: Mahesh Bhatt
Cast: Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil
Genre: romance, drama
This is truly mature cinema. Mahesh Bhattâ€™s breakout film â€˜Arthâ€™ was partly autobiographical, giving it a sense of intimacy still rare in Hindi cinema. Pooja (Azmi) finds the bubble of her happy marriage starting to burst when she discovers that her filmmaker husband, Inder (Kharbanda), is having an affair with Kavita (Patil). Poojaâ€™s search for her own identity leads her to many revelations, while Inder is ultimately left alone.
The big sceneDrunken Pooja and Kavita finally meet in person, and chauvinist Inder has no option but to see exactly whatâ€™s happening in his life as the film takes a feminist turn.
Varun Grover
Director: Sanjay Gadhvi
Cast: Abhishek Bachchan, Uday Chopra, John Abraham
Genre: action
Bollywoodâ€™s most successful modern franchise features stylish villains on the run from a lovable yet inept duo: policeman Dixit (Bachchan) and Ali (Chopra), a thief whose help he seeks out. So far there have been three â€˜Dhoomâ€™ movies, and in this first one the villain was Kabir (Abraham), the head of a motorbike gang. The series is heavily defined by its stunt action set pieces and owes a big debt to the likes of â€˜The Fast and the Furiousâ€™ and â€˜Oceanâ€™s Elevenâ€™.
The big sceneThe bike chase scene, with the duo jumping over a moving train while dodging bullets.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Sujoy Ghosh
Cast: Vidya Balan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Parambrata Chatterjee
Genre: thriller, drama
A heavily pregnant woman (Vidya Balan) arrives in Kolkata alone and goes straight to the police station. But why? So begins a shadowy quest to track down her missing husband and a gauntlet of police officers inclined to dismiss the worries of a pregnant woman. Slowly, director Sujoy Ghosh draws them â€“ and us â€“ into her web of secrets and lies, as the mission begins to morph into something more sinister. Ghosh expertly sows the culture of Kolkata deep into his thriller, so much so that the city becomes a character in the story and a much-needed ally for Vidya.
The big scene:In the climax, as Vidyaâ€™s intentions are revealed and theÂ cops give chase, she slips into a crowd of women in a parade. The womenÂ accept her without question and smear her face with the red powderÂ to prevent her capture.Â Sahir Avik Dâ€™souza
Director: Abhinav Kashyap
Cast: Salman Khan, Sonakshi Sinha, Sonu Sood
Genre: action, drama, musical
Writer-director Abhinav Kashyap paid tribute to 1970s Hindi cinema with this entertaining action movie that gave actor Salman Khanâ€™s stardom a boost, and revived the masala genre in a major way (not entirely a good thing). Khan plays the iconic Chulbul Pandey, a corrupt cop in north India who goes after politicians and gangsters and refers to himself as â€˜Robin Hoodâ€™ Pandey. There are several plot holes, but the film rides on a breezy script, Khanâ€™s charm and some well-choreographed action scenes.
The big sceneThe musical number â€˜Munni Badnaam Huiâ€™ (â€˜Munni was defamedâ€™) brought back the â€˜item songâ€™ (a crude term to describe a song featuring scantily dressed women) in a big way.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali
Cast: Rani Mukerji, Amitabh Bachchan
Genre: drama
This drama about a deaf-mute woman, Michelle (Mukerji), and her struggle through education was loosely inspired by the true story of Helen Keller. Like most films directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali (â€˜Guzaarishâ€™), â€˜Blackâ€™ is at times uncomfortably manipulative and awkward in its attempt to inspire. But thereâ€™s no denying that Bhansali conjures up gorgeous worlds. Strong heroines and stories of female ambition are still fairly rare in Hindi movies, and itâ€™s impossible not to cheer for the determined Michelle as she stumbles in the shadows.
The big sceneMichelle gains her university degree and makes a moving speech to the graduating class.
Beth Watkins
Director: Anubhav SinhaÂ Â 
Cast: Taapsee Pannu, Dia Mirza, Ratna Pathak Shah, Manav Kaul, Pavail Gulati
Genre: dramaÂ Â 
â€˜Just a slap â€“ but he canâ€™t hit me,â€™ says a tremblingly defiant Amrita (Taapsee Pannu) in Thappad. A perfect housewife and daughter-in-law, she has found no reason to complain until in a sudden and uncharacteristic moment of stress her husband Vikram (Gulati) slaps her. Itâ€™s the first time heâ€™s done this, but this one act opens Amritaâ€™s eyes to the many tiny injustices of the life sheâ€™s been living. She asks for a divorce, and sticks by her decision even when she learns she is pregnant. This feminist drama tells Amritaâ€™s story, but surrounds it with stories of the women around her â€“ her mother, her mother-in-law, her neighbour, her lawyer, her neighbourâ€™s daughter, her brotherâ€™s girlfriend â€“ and their relationships with the men in their lives. Pannuâ€™s stirring performance anchors it all.The big scene: Vikram asks their neighbour, a witness to the slap, to lie to the authorities and testify that he didnâ€™t assault his wife. A widow, she fixes him with a beady look and mentions her beloved late husband. â€˜I would like to believe men are wonderful people,â€™ she says, â€˜so I will pretend I did not hear what you just said.â€™
Sahir Avik Dâ€™souza
Director: Shekhar Kapur
Cast: Seema Biswas
Genre: drama
The novelist Arundhati Roy criticised Shekhar Kapurâ€™s version of the life of Phoolan Devi (Biswas) for simplifying the criminal-turned-politicianâ€™s experiences to fit a typical rape-revenge story. Devi was a bandit who was jailed for acts of revenge against people who abused her as a child and who later became a politician. But â€˜Bandit Queenâ€™ remains a harrowing depiction of fearful and unforgiving lives in rural Uttar Pradesh. The film succeeds in making us all witnesses to its horrors â€“ and complicit in them when, like so many of the characters, we say nothing.
The big sceneDevi and her gang attack a wedding party in search of recompense for the horrors she suffered in her youth.
Beth Watkins
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Rakhee Gulzar, Shashi Kapoor
Genre: romance, drama
Yash Chopraâ€™s most romantic movie is a superior Bollywood soap dealing with intergenerational love, personal sacrifices and secrets and lies in the lives of two middle-class Delhi families. College sweethearts Amit (Bachchan) and Pooja (Gulzar) separate when Pooja announces that her parents have arranged her marriage to Vijay (Kapoor). Years later, the respective adults and their teenage kids meetâ€¦ The filmâ€™s strong social messages â€“ that the past is the past and that the younger generation will marry the partners of their choice â€“ hold true today.
The big sceneIf there is only one Bollywood soundtrack you ever listen to, it has to be this one, with the title track widely considered to be the best Bollywood song ever.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Vikramaditya Motwane
Cast: Rajat Barmecha, Sanjay Gandhi
Genre: drama
After spending eight years at a boarding school, 16-year-old Rohan (Barmecha) is expelled and returns home to Jamshedpur to discover that his father has remarried and been widowed a second time in his absence. Rohan also has a young stepbrother he knew nothing about. He dreams of becoming a writer, but instead heâ€™s forced to work in the family business and later to attend engineering school. â€˜Udaanâ€™ offers a realistic set-up, a simple story familiar to many Indians and some superb, understated performances. This isnâ€™t the classic idea of Bollywood, but itâ€™s a strong film nevertheless.
The big sceneRohan and his father jog together each morning: one day Rohan finally outruns his father, metaphorically and literally.
Shai Hussain
Director: Shyam Benegal
Cast: Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Manoj Bajpayee
Genre: romance
The voice of Bollywoodâ€™s nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and the music of composer AR Rahman sweep through this poignant period tale about Zubeida, the beautiful mistress to a king. Karisma Kapoor plays the doe-eyed princess to perfection, and Khalid Mohamed, son of actress Zubeida Begum, wrote the script, based on the tragic life story of his own mother.
The big sceneDuring a ritual in Zubeidaâ€™s first marriage, she runs out, saying sheâ€™s â€˜not a bride but a goat about to be sacrificedâ€™, before trying to shoot herself with her fatherâ€™s pistol.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Basu Bhattacharya
Cast: Raj Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman
Genre:Â romance
Bullock-cart driver Hiraman (Kapoor) takes a mysterious female passenger, Hirabai (Rehman), to a faraway fair. En route, they bond over some meaningful songs and food. She reveals that she is a dancer. They arrive at their destination and the villagers speculate that Hirabai may actually be a whore. Hiraman appears oblivious; he is smitten. Pure star power, frequent songs, and scenic black-and-white cinematography of rural Bihar (the monochrome was a deliberate choice, as Indiaâ€™s first colour film was in 1964) combine to sustain interest in this progressive culture-class-clash love story.
The big sceneThe title translates as â€˜three vowsâ€™, and itâ€™s the final vow that brings on the tears.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Manmohan Desai
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Shatrughan Sinha, Rishi Kapoor
Genre: drama
Manmohan Desaiâ€™s star-filled film repeats his customary â€˜lost and foundâ€™ formula of villains separating a young family who in adulthood reunite to seek revenge. Desaiâ€™s frequent use of two-second shots and close-ups whips the proceedings along. Like his earlier classic â€˜Amar Akbar Anthonyâ€™ (1977), this is Bollywood kitsch at its best.
The big sceneThe entire film is a series of highlights, including a boxing match, a glass mansion on fire and a climactic song with the three heroes and their girls dressed as characters including matadors, Cossacks and Chaplin.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Prakash Mehra
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Ajit, Pran
Genre: action, drama
The action-packed â€˜Zanjeerâ€™ was an early masterpiece from the writing duo Salim-Javed, giving Amitabh Bachchan his first major role and cementing his â€˜Angry Young Manâ€™ status. Itâ€™s an unapologetically bitter and stylish revenge story about an honest cop, Vijay (Bachchan), who has been haunted since childhood by nightmares about his fatherâ€™s murder by a stranger â€“ but all thatâ€™s known about the killer is that he wore a bracelet with a white stallion charm. As an adult, Vijayâ€™s path crosses the gangster responsible, Teja (Ajit), and the stage is set for a final showdown.
The big sceneVijayâ€™s first couple of interactions with Sher Khan (Pran), the goon with a golden heart, see the script hitting the sweet spot.
Varun Grover
Director: Vishal Bhardwaj
Cast: Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan
Genre: drama
Vishal Bhardwajâ€™s modern â€˜Othelloâ€™, set in northern Indiaâ€™s Uttar Pradesh, sidesteps Bollywood bombast and keeps its emotions in check. Bhardwaj extracts surprising performances from actors previously associated with more populist work: his cast display real torment and depth, particularly Saif Ali Khan as a deformed, scheming â€˜Iagoâ€™ (called Langda here). â€˜Omkaraâ€™ is one of Bhardwajâ€™s three adaptations of Shakespeare for Hindi cinema: 2003â€™s â€˜Maqboolâ€™ interpreted â€˜Macbethâ€™, while 2014â€™s â€˜Haiderâ€™ did the same for â€˜Hamletâ€™.
The big sceneThe climax when the fate of Omkaraâ€™s lover, Dolly (Kapoor) â€“ falsely accused of having an affair â€“ is finally sealed.
Beth Watkins
Director: Basu Chatterjee
Cast: Amol Palekar, Vidya Sinha, Ashok Kumar
Genre: romance, comedy, musical
An expert at depicting the urban middle class, director Basu Chatterjeeâ€™s protagonist in â€˜Chhoti Si Baatâ€™ is once again a simple man (played expertly by Palekar) faced with simple problems and finding simple solutions to deal with them. Arun is an unconfident man who fantasises about wooing Prabha (Sinha). He is taken under the wing of a fun-loving colonel (Kumar), who helps young men overcome their shortcomings. An adaptation of â€˜School for Scoundrelsâ€™, the film is best remembered for its portrayal of 1970s Bombay and its quirky humour.
The big sceneA montage of the colonel training Arun, and telling him that the world is divided between winners and losers. â€˜In the cricket of life, thereâ€™s no draw.â€™
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Vijay Anand
Cast: Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja
Genre: thriller
This spy thriller tells of Vinay (Anand), an ordinary young man with a striking resemblance to a jewel thief, Amar (also Anand). Itâ€™s three hours of decadence, with loose gems, fast women and a hero on the run. Its staying power comes not just from its extraordinary visual indulgences â€“ the film is candy-coloured, classy and sexy â€“ but also from a brilliant script that carefully reveals layer after layer and eventually turns one of Hindi cinemaâ€™s favourite tropes on its head. Almost 50 years later, watching the details unfold is still a breathtaking experience.
The big sceneThe songs are all knockouts, but â€˜Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paasâ€™, with the actress Helen shimmying on a bar in feathers, zebra print and spangled red fishnets, proves that more is indeed more.
Beth Watkins
Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Madhuri Dixit, Jackie Shroff
Genre: drama, romance
Extravagant yet still full of heart: Sanjay Leela Bhansaliâ€™s opulent adaptation of Sarat Chandraâ€™s simplistic novel marked a move into excessive theatricality for the director, whose films since include â€˜Guzaarishâ€™ and â€˜Saawariyaâ€™. His style was at its most organic and daring in â€˜Devdasâ€™. Its main characters, Devdas (Khan) and Paro (Rai), are childhood lovers, but class differences and difficult parents cause them to separate. Full of spite, Devdas goes on a drinking binge and ends up in the arms of a dancing girl, Chandramukhi (Dixit). Chandramukhi falls in love with a broken Devdas, but he canâ€™t think of anything beyond Paro, alcohol and death.
The big sceneA drunk Devdas expresses his anger at his father by jumping into a pond and performing his own last rites.
Varun Grover
Director: Nitin Bose
Cast: Dilip Kumar, Nasir Khan
Genre: action, drama
This 1961 drama helped to set the template for what would become a Bollywood staple: stories of brothers on opposite sides of the law. Poverty-stricken villager Gunga (Kumar) scrapes together just enough money to fund an education for his younger brother Jumna (Khan). Jumna becomes a police officer, while Gunga joins a group of bandits after heroically defending his love against a powerful landowner. The brothers head towards an unavoidable face-off.
The big sceneWhen Jumnaâ€™s fellow police officers open fire on Gangaâ€™s bandits, and the two men remember that, despite everything thatâ€™s happened, theyâ€™re still brothers.
Shai Hussain
Director: Bimal Roy
Cast: Dilip Kumar, Vyjayantimala, Pran
Genre: romance, thriller, musical
Director Bimal Royâ€™s rare foray into commercial cinema was a heady cocktail of revenge, romance and reincarnation, with a supernatural element thrown in. City-bred Anand (Kumar) moves to a village to manage the estate of the evil Ugaranarayan (the legendary Pran), who rapes and murders Anandâ€™s lover, Madhumati (Vyjayantimala). A grief-stricken Anand finds a lookalike of Madhumati and talks her into luring Ugaranayaran to confess his crime. The film boasts a brilliant score by Salil Choudhury.
The big sceneAnand thinks that Madhumatiâ€™s lookalike is extracting a confession from Ugaranarayan and then realises itâ€™s actually her ghost.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Sridevi, Rishi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna
Genre: romance, drama
Itâ€™s the ultimate love triangle: Rohit (Kapoor) and Chandni (Sridevi) meet at a wedding and fall in love. But just before they get married, an accident takes away Rohitâ€™s legs and self-esteem, forcing Chandni to exit the relationship. She meets Lalit (Khanna), who himself is nursing a broken heart, and things get complicated. Director Yash Chopraâ€™s clever handling of the story, which offers a distinctly female perspective on troubled love, makes â€˜Chandniâ€™ rise way above the pack.
The big sceneWhen a recuperating Rohit meets Lalit and they talk about the girls they love, unaware that both are talking about the same person.
Varun Grover
Director: Amit Maitra, Sombhu Mitra
Cast: Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Motilal
Genre: drama, satire, musical
This experimental film by directing duo Amit Maitra and Sombhu Mitra sees Raj Kapoor playing a thirsty villager stuck in a city apartment block after being mistaken for a thief. Kapoorâ€™s unnamed character moves from one part of the building to another, coming across several people, all of whom hide murky secrets. This largely single-character-driven film features several cameo appearances by well-known Hindi film actors, each playing various urban folk who Kapoor is first scared of, and later comes to despise.
The big sceneThe great actor Motilal appears in one scene of the film, drunkenly singing the song â€˜Zindagi Khwab Haiâ€™ (â€˜Life is a dreamâ€™).
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Advait Chandan
Cast: Zaira Wasim, Meher Vij, Raj Arjun, Aamir Khan
Genre: drama, musical
The highest grossing Indian film to boast a female lead, â€˜Secret Superstarâ€™ is more than just another Bollywood musical. The film follows the journey of Insia (Wasim), a teenager who dreams of escaping her abusive father and becoming a singer. After a video of herself singing a song while wearing a niqab to protect her identity goes viral, she has to either face her fatherâ€™s wrath or give up her dream. At its heart, though, this is a film about the relationship between mother and daughter that explores womenâ€™s positions in Indiaâ€™s traditional, male-dominated society.Â Â 
The big sceneWhen Insia tells her mother that they should flee their abusive home, leaving her young brother, Guddu, behind, and her mother says that Guddu will grow up to be just like his father if they abandon him.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Samir Ganguli
Cast: Shashi Kapoor, Raakhee
Genre: romance, thriller
â€˜Sharmeeleeâ€™ is a typical example of that Bollywood storytelling staple: good twin versus bad twin. Ajit (Kapoor) marries the shy Kanchan (Raakhee), thinking she is the vivacious Kamini (also Raakhee), not realising they are identical twins. Kamini spots the couple at a nightclub and decides she can have the domestic bliss she craves by eradicating her meek sister and taking her place. The outlandish plot is played straight as it clumsily examines the nature of surface beauty and inner goodness. The filmâ€™s main selling point today is SD Burmanâ€™s soundtrack, especially the undervalued Lata Mangeshkar solo â€˜Megha Chhaye Aadhi Raatâ€™ (â€˜Dark clouds have covered the skiesâ€™).
The big sceneAn exploitative and dated rape sequence in which the baddie manhandles the leading lady and exposes her underwear.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Bimal Roy
Cast: Ashok Kumar, Meena Kumari
Genre: romance, drama
Understated elegance is the order of the day in this adaptation of a Bengali novel. As brought to life by director Bimal Roy, itâ€™s a nuanced tale of true love lost and found, with astute performances from celebrated actors Ashok Kumar and Meena Kumari. The 2005 remake was similarly well received, and made Vidya Balan an overnight star in India.
The big sceneThe show-stopping theatrical dance piece â€˜Ae Bandi Tumâ€™, performed by Gopi Krishna and Roshan Kumari and sung by Asha Bhosle and Kishore Kumar.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Vikramaditya Motwane
Cast: Ranveer Singh, Sonakshi Sinha, Adil Hussain
Genre: romance, thriller, musical
Vikramaditya Motwane re-imagined O Henryâ€™s short story â€˜The Last Leafâ€™ for this film about a simple girl, Pakhi (Sinha), who falls in love with a robber, Varun (Singh), when he arrives in her town pretending to be an archaeologist. Effectively recreating the 1950s era, complete with Dev Anand film songs playing on the radio, â€˜Looteraâ€™ brought together an ace technical team made up of production designer Aditya Kanwar and cinematographer Mahendra Shetty, who gave the film a distinct, lush period look.
The big sceneA sick Pakhi steadily rejects Varunâ€™s advances while he seeks refuge in her house after running away from the police.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Mahesh Bhatt
Cast: Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla
Genre: romance, comedy
In this remake of Cary Grantâ€™s â€˜Houseboatâ€™ (1958), Vyjayanti (Chawla), the bubbly daughter of a conservative Tamil family, escapes from an upcoming forced marriage and finds kindred spirits in three children who decide to hide her at their home, under the nose of their guardian Rahul (Khan). When Rahul discovers her, she becomes the childrenâ€™s governess and what follows is a story of love between opposites. A wonderfully sweet soundtrack accompanies this delightful, light and entertaining family comedy.
The big sceneWhen Rahul finally stands up for Vyjayantiâ€™s honour in defiance of his boss.
Shai Hussain
Director: MS Sathyu
Cast: Balraj Sahni, Farooque Shaikh, AK Hangal
Genre: history, drama
Also known as â€˜Scorching Windsâ€™, this is perhaps the most important and accurate Indian film to depict the plight of minority Muslims in northern India following Partition in 1947. Set in the late 1940s, Salim (Sahni), an elderly Muslim shoemaker must decide whether or not to leave his ancestral home in Agra and migrate across the border to newly-created Pakistan. Meanwhile, Hindu-Muslim tensions at home threaten to rip apart his family. Director MS Sathyu, a Marxist activist, created a heart-wrenching tale of innocent lives torn apart by hatred and suspicion. Balraj Sahniâ€™s noble performance will move you to tears, and the issues are equally relevant to India today.
The big sceneWhen the grandmother hides away in order to stay in her â€˜homeâ€™.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Guru Dutt
Cast: Guru Dutt, Madhubala, Johnny Walker
Genre: comedy
Director Guru Dutt uses a familiar plot to hilarious effect in this satire of Indiaâ€™s urban upper class in the post-independence period. Anita (Madhubala) can only inherit her fatherâ€™s wealth if she gets married â€“ leading her feminist aunt to suggest that she goes through a â€˜fakeâ€™ marriage with cartoonist Preetam (Dutt) and then â€˜divorceâ€™ as soon as possible afterwards. But, of course, both Anita and Preetam fall in loveâ€¦ Duttâ€™s unique directing style is put to inventive use during the songs: the camera appears never to sit still. The film is best remembered today for the tunes sung by Geeta Dutt (the directorâ€™s wife) and for being truly funny. Itâ€™s an irresistible and impeccably cast film.
The big sceneThe heroineâ€™s swimming-pool song â€“ which comes complete with charming chorus girls twirling umbrellas.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Sachin Kundalkar
Cast: Rani Mukerji, Prithviraj, Anita Date
Genre: romance, comedy, musical
Filmmaker Sachin Kundalkar took one of three parallel stories he previously told in the 2009 Marathi-language film â€˜Gandhaâ€™ and turned it into a madcap Hindi comedy with fantasy elements. Meenakshi (Mukerji) falls in love with Tamil boy Surya (Prithviraj) after sheâ€™s drawn to his smell. The bizarre characters around Meenakshi include her father, who smokes four cigarettes at once; a grandmother with gold teeth; and her friend Mynah (a superb Date), who has a weird Lady Gaga obsession.
The big sceneMeenakshi finds herself fantasising about romancing with Surya while dancing to an archetypal Tamil cinema-inspired song thatâ€™s garish, vulgar and full of pelvic thrusts.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Shashi Kapoor, Zeenat Aman
Genre: romance
Raj Kapoorâ€™s attempt to portray the conflict between the sacred and the profane, and to show that beauty is only skin deep, is an admittedly patchy affair. When engineer Ranjeev (Shashi Kapoor) hears the religious songs sung by â€˜uglyâ€™ village belle Rupa (Aman), he is convinced her face will be as beautiful as her voice. He marries her without seeing her, so the shallow groom is understandably upset on his wedding night. Itâ€™s a flawed masterpiece that is guilty of exactly of what it purports to criticise. But itâ€™s also groundbreaking for its sexual explicitness, including wet kisses. Excellent soundtrack, too.
The big sceneAny scene with lead actress Zeenat Aman: she is practically topless for most of the film.
Anil Sinanan
Director: SS Rajamouli
Cast: Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah Batia, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan, Sathyaraj, Nassar
Genre: fantasy, action, musical
These blockbusters play like the Bollywood â€˜Black Pantherâ€™. Inspired by Indian mythology and the Amar Chitra Katha comic-book series, director SS Rajamouliâ€™s two-part fantasy epic about a young man, Shivudu, who later discovers his name is Mahendra Baahubali (donâ€™t ask, itâ€™s complicated), offers some of the most spectacular Indian cinema ever made. Both films blend high fantasy and action with an almost Shakespearean sense of drama, resulting in a double bill that knows when to rein it in. Just. Like the â€˜Wakanda forever!â€™ salute in â€˜Black Pantherâ€™, â€˜Baahubaliâ€™ will always be associated with the chant â€˜Jai Mahishmathiâ€™.Â 
The big sceneWhen Mahendra Baahubaliâ€™s father,Â  Amarendra shows off his strength by lifting a gargantuan statute of the Hindu god Shiva, preventing it from falling and killing people.Â 
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Abrar Alvi
Cast: Meena Kumari, Rehman, Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman
Genre: drama
â€˜Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulamâ€™ is a period film about the end of an era. Abrar Alviâ€™s adaptation of a Bengali novel by Bimal Mitra is about the stormy relationship between a rich, decadent business owner (Rehman), his lovelorn wife (Meena Kumari) and their young servant (Guru Dutt). Itâ€™s all told against the backdrop of the last days of the old system of zamindari (a way of collecting tax) in colonial, nineteenth-century Bengal. Shot with great sensitivity and innovation by Guru Duttâ€™s main man VK Murthy, â€˜Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulamâ€™ is a more romantic twin to Satyajit Rayâ€™s â€˜Jalsagharâ€™.
The big sceneA drunk Kumari pleads with her arrogant husband to stay and make love to her via the song â€˜Na jao saiyanâ€™ â€“ a bold scene back then.
Varun Grover
Director: N Chandra
Cast: Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher
Genre: romance, drama
Actor Anil Kapoor followed his 1987 super-hit â€˜Mr Indiaâ€™ with this film (the title means â€˜Acidâ€™) that gave actress Madhuri Dixit her breakout role, swept the box office and won four Filmfare awards (Bollywoodâ€™s equivalent to the Oscars). It tells of a criminal, Munna (Kapoor), trying to get himself back on the right side of the law while also attempting to rescue his love, Mohini (Dixit), from the grasp of her villainous father. Itâ€™s passionate and violent.
The big sceneThe song and video for â€˜Ek Do Teenâ€™ (â€˜One Two Threeâ€™) by composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal put actress and dance queen Dixit firmly on the Bollywood map.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Raj Kapoor, Vyjayanthimala, Rajendra Kumar
Genre: drama, romance
This is cinema as love song. Two best friends from childhood, Sunder (Kapoor) and Gopal (Kumar) love the same girl, Radha (Vyjayanthimala). She marries Sunder, the one she doesnâ€™t love, but then he goes missing at war. When Sunder returns, the discovery of an old love letter sows seeds of suspicion and friendships are tested. The standard love-triangle template is made exotic by Shankar-Jaikishanâ€™s timeless music and Raj Kapoorâ€™s love for foreign locales.
The big sceneThe accusatory song on piano â€“ â€˜Dost dost na rahaâ€™ (â€˜Friend did not remain a friendâ€™) â€“ is one of a kind in Hindi cinema (a man berating another man for trying to steal his woman), and the most intense point of the film.
Varun Grover
Director: Imtiaz Ali
Cast: Ranbir Kapoor, Nargis Fakhri, Aditi Rao Hydari
Genre: musical, romance, drama
Ranbir Kapoor embodied the filmâ€™s tortured, Jim Morrison-like protagonist Jordan so convincingly that he had to keep reminding people that he wasnâ€™t a real rock star. Jordan is one of Indian cinemaâ€™s most complex male characters. This, as well as glimpses of hidden India â€“ like Nizamuddin Dargah, the mausoleum of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya, in Delhi â€“ and the last appearance of Bollywood legend Shammi Kapoor (â€˜Jungleeâ€™) make â€˜Rockstarâ€™ a noteworthy addition to the rock biopic pantheon.
The big sceneâ€¨The heart-wrenching montage during the song â€˜Nadaan Parindeyâ€™ as we see Jordan overcome with debilitating grief.
Ashanti OmkarÂ 
Director: Farah Khan
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Sushmita Sen, Sunil Shetty
Genre: comedy, drama
Military man Ram (Khan) goes undercover as a university student in the name of peace between India and Pakistan. While stalking the villain, Ram also loses his heart to a chemistry professor. â€˜Main Hoon Naâ€™ exists in a knowingly meta world where global superstar Shah Rukh Khan involuntarily bursts into song every time Miss Universe (Sen) glides by. The film dances that fine line between parody and celebration like no mainstream Hindi film before or since. Itâ€™s a celebration of all things filmi â€“ family reunions, the redemptive power of love, fantasies played out in song â€“ while also reveling in how ridiculous it can all be.
The big sceneIn front of a huge crowd, Ram saves the life of his younger brother, whoâ€™s about to fall to his death from the roof of the university. One onlooker nicknames him â€˜Ramboâ€™.
Beth Watkins
Director: Vikas Bahl
Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Rajkummar Rao, Lisa Haydon
Genre: drama, musical
A fiercely original filmmaking style and a novel plot made â€˜Queenâ€™ stand apart from all other 2014 releases, helping it to emerge as a critical and box-office hit. In a career-altering performance, Kangana Ranaut plays Rani, a sheltered small-town girl who decides to go on her honeymoon to Europe alone after sheâ€™s jilted at the altar. Writer-director Vikas Bahl displays a strong flair for capturing human behaviour and peppers a simple story with lovable characters and witty lines.
The big sceneRaniâ€™s ex-lover begs her to return, but she simply thanks him for cancelling their wedding and thereby allowing her to discover herself.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Raj Kapoor, Simi Garewal, Rishi Kapoor
Genre: romance, biopic
Director-star Raj Kapoorâ€™s semi-autobiographical magnum opus is four hours of self-loathing angst, which crashed at the box office and almost bankrupted the director-actor. A sad clown, Raju (Kapoor), invites the women he loved and lost in his life to his last ever performance. Told in three â€˜chaptersâ€™, this overlong film is awash with iffy symbolism about the meaning of life, exhibits a questionable attitude towards women and is burdened with a mother-fixation subplot. But for all its flaws, this is no-holds-barred epic filmmaking with a moving soundtrack.
The big sceneRajuâ€™s mother collapses and dies just as heâ€™s about to perform â€“ but the show must go on.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Karan Johar
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji
Genre: romance, musical
Director Karan Johar began his association with Shah Rukh Khan with this romantic drama partly inspired by the Archie-Veronica-Betty trio in the American Archie comics. Rahul (Khan) and Anjali (Kajol) are best friends studying in the same college, but the tomboyish Anjali is threatened by the arrival of Tina (Mukerji). Years later, widower Rahul reconnects with Anjali. The film was a runaway hit, best remembered for Khan and Kajolâ€™s sizzling chemistry and Jatin-Lalitâ€™s music.
The big sceneAnjali is unaware that one of her students, also named Anjali, is actually Rahul and Tinaâ€™s daughter. Then she watches Rahul on TV, who sends out a message about how much he misses â€˜Anjaliâ€™.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Mani Ratnam
Cast: Kamal Haasan, Saranya, Nasser
Genre: crime, thriller
â€˜Nayakanâ€™, the original, 1987 Tamil version of this film, was dubbed into Hindi in 1999 to become â€˜Velu Nayakanâ€™. An epic crime movie, itâ€™s loosely based on the life of Varadarajan Mudaliar (here becoming Velu Nayakan, played by Haasan), a real mafia slumlord in Bombay, and also explores the struggle of south Indians living in the city. It drew inspiration from Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s â€˜The Godfatherâ€™. The song â€˜Thenpandi cheemaiyileâ€™ tops a much-admired soundtrack by veteran Indian film composer Ilaiyaraaja, who has now scored over 1000 films in his career.
The big sceneYouâ€™re bound to feel an emotional tug every time you hear the song â€˜Sitam Ki Andhiâ€™ (â€˜Who has hit you?â€™) sung by Bollywood stalwart Hariharan.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Sooraj Barjatya
Cast: Salman Khan, Bhagyashree, Alok Nath
Genre: romance, drama
Prem (Khan), a boy from a wealthy family, pursues forbidden love with working-class girl Suman (Bhagyashree). So far, so Bollywood, but â€˜Maine Pyar Kiyaâ€™ managed simultaneously to kickstart megastar Salman Khanâ€™s career, cement director Sooraj Barjatyaâ€™s box-office clout and redefine romance and friendship in Bollywood in a way that wasnâ€™t bettered for years. Released in a decade signified by violent masala flicks, this family-friendly film with an evergreen soundtrack and iconic dialogue was immediately and widely admired.
The big sceneWhen Prem and Suman attend a party and their boy-girl friendship is mocked, Prem stands up for Sumanâ€™s honour and they fall in love. Obviously.
Shai Hussain
Director: Rajkumar Santoshi
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn
Genre: drama, action, thriller
Amitabh Bachchan broke on to the scene with the role of angst-ridden cop Vijay in â€˜Zanjeerâ€™ (1973). â€˜Khakeeâ€™ explores what would have happened to the character 30 years later. Vijay is an honest policeman who gets entangled in an operation that involves transferring a terrorist from a small village to the city. But as the ageing officer and his team go about their mission, they realise there are influential people who want the terrorist dead â€“ so their lives are in danger too.
The big sceneBachchan berates another cop for being a puppet of the establishment â€“ itâ€™s exactly the kind of monologue weâ€™ve come to associate with the actor over the years.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Ritesh Batra
Cast: Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur, Nawazuddin Siddiqui
Genre: romance, drama, comedy
Ritesh Batraâ€™s debut film turned out to be Indiaâ€™s most popular export in recent times, with rave reviews at Cannes followed by a wide release in the US, where the film ended up among the highest-grossing foreign-language films of the year. Simply structured yet purposeful, â€˜The Lunchboxâ€™ focuses on the lives of two lonely individuals, Saajan (Khan) and Ila (Kaur). Both jostle for some peace and happiness amid the buzz and mayhem of Mumbai, as they share notes through a tiffin box delivered back and forth.
The big sceneSaajan is invited to dinner by his lowly colleague Shaikh (Siddiqui), and he bonds with Shaikh and his girlfriend.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Mani Ratnam
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Manisha Koirala, Preity Zinta
Genre: romance, drama, musical
â€˜Dil Se..â€™ was acclaimed south Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnamâ€™s big plunge into Bollywood, achieved by teaming up with superstar Shah Rukh Khan. A box-office failure at the time, this story of a Delhi journalist falling in love with a terrorist has gained popularity in the years since. Ratnamâ€™s interest in political issues may have clashed with Khanâ€™s lover-boy image at the time, but at least the actor has one solid drama in his otherwise monotonous filmography.
The big sceneAce cinematographer Santosh Sivan shot Khan and Malaika Arora on top of a moving train dancing to AR Rahmanâ€™s â€˜Chaiyya Chaiyyaâ€™, a song that would go on to become a national hit.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Karan Johar
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan
Genre: melodrama, romance, musical
â€˜Itâ€™s all about loving your parents,â€™ screamed the trailer for â€˜Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Ghamâ€¦â€™, a film that piled on the mush in true Karan Johar (â€˜My Name is Khanâ€™) style. Here, Johar brought together a dream cast to play a fractured family. Billionaire Yashvardhan (Bachchan) is an authoritarian who banishes his adopted son Rahul (Khan) for marrying a woman against his wishes. Years later, Rajâ€™s brother Rohan (Roshan) strives to bring the family together. Boasting opulent production design, lavish musical set pieces and an orgy of superstars, â€˜K3Gâ€™ (as the film came to be known) is guilty-pleasure Bollywood at its best.
The big sceneRahul and Rohan reunite after several years. Sat on a park bench, Rahul asks Rohan questions about things they had talked about when Rohan was just a kid.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Ashutosh Gowariker
Cast: Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sonu Sood
Genre: historical, romance, drama
This story of real-life Mughal emperor Akbar (Roshan) and his Hindu wife Jodhaa (Bachchan) doesnâ€™t exactly follow the facts. But when artistic license is exercised so beautifully, who cares? Ashutosh Gowariker, director of the Oscar-nominated â€˜Lagaanâ€™, executes a perfect balance of spectacle, performances, ideas and story, never sacrificing the entertainment factor and allowing us to bask in the costumes and production design. He drenches his always-timely message of respect for all faiths in immeasurable imperial pomp.
The big sceneA sizzling sword fight between the emperor and the princess, a woman with serious physical presence who refuses to bow her head.
Beth Watkins
Director: AR Murugadoss
Cast: Aamir Khan, Asin, Jiah Khan
Genre: romance, thriller
Bearing many similarities to Christopher Nolanâ€™s â€˜Mementoâ€™, this way-over-the-top thriller leans heavily on its main characterâ€™s short-term-memory loss. Sanjay (Aamir Khan) is a leading Indian businessman, while Kalpana (Asin), a model, brags to everyone that she is Sanjayâ€™s girl even though theyâ€™ve never met. When Sanjay discovers this, he decides to confront her but soon falls in love. However, Kalpana falls foul of a local crime lord and Sanjay is determined to avenge her deathâ€¦ â€˜Ghajiniâ€™ was an enormous hit in India.
The big sceneSanjay is attacked by gangsters and suffers short-term amnesia. He tattoos memory prompts all over his body. Heard that somewhere before?
Anushka Arora
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Shatrugan Sinha
Genre: action, crime, thriller, historical
The common manâ€™s exploitation by greedy industrialists is the theme of â€˜Kaala Pattharâ€™, which loosely references the 1975 Chasnala disaster in which 375 miners drowned. Amitabh Bachchan plays sullen loner Vijay, a disgraced naval officer who abandoned a sinking ship; Shashi Kapoor is clean-cut engineer Ravi; and Shatrugan Sinha is escaped convict Mangal. Despite Raviâ€™s protests, the mine owner sacrifices safety for profit, but when the mine is flooded the trio unites. â€˜Kaala Pattharâ€™ wears its proletarian heart on its sleeve.
The big sceneWhen the mine siren sounds, the entire workforce and surrounding village rush to help. Itâ€™s a striking symbol of the power of the collective over the individual.
Rahul Verma
Director: Shimit Amin
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shukla, Vidya Malvade
Genre: sports, drama, musical
Between clever gangster movie â€˜Ab Tak Chhappanâ€™ (2004) and the grossly underrated â€˜Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Yearâ€™ (2009), director Shimit Amin teamed up with writer Jaideep Sahni to give us this quintessential sports drama. The film narrates the story of a tainted ex-India hockey player (Khan) who coaches the womenâ€™s team to World Cup glory. While sticking to the underdog-overcomes-obstacles template, Amin and Sahni deftly weave in themes of cultural diversity, religious difference and feminism.
The big sceneThe girlsâ€™ team goes up against the boysâ€™ national team, winning the respect of the opposing team and the selectors.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Kabir Khan
Cast: Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Ranvir Shorey
Genre: action, romance
Salman Khan adds a dash of cosmopolitan sophistication to his special brand of machismo with this story involving espionage and a love affair with an enemy agent (Kaif). As Tiger, Khan adheres to the muscle-man template, but he also struggles over questions of loyalty to his lady or his country â€“ a complexity not always afforded to Indiaâ€™s defenders. This same dilemma is mirrored in Tigerâ€™s colleague, Gopi (Shorey), who may have to rat out his friend.
The big sceneTiger crashes through Dublinâ€™s public transport system â€“ a proud addition to the tradition of Bollywood heroes wreaking havoc in foreign locales.
Beth Watkins
Director: Shyam Benegal
Cast: Shabana Azmi, Anant Nag
Genre: drama
â€˜Ankurâ€™ is the film that kickstarted an â€˜arty-indieâ€™ parallel film movement in Hindi cinema in the 1970s and early â€™80s. Shyam Benegalâ€™s directorial debut introduces Shabana Azmi (â€˜Indiaâ€™s Meryl Streepâ€™) as Laxmi, the servant-wife of a deaf and dumb untouchable potter. Laxmi falls pregnant by bored middle-class student Surya (Nag) at his familyâ€™s holiday farmhouse. The rest of this admirable and realistic film explores the fallout from these events and bravely adopts a strong feminist stance. Gritty and political, this is an elegiac and essential rural melodrama.
The big sceneThe filmâ€™s final sequence: a young boy throws a brick at the landlordâ€™s house, suggesting that the unfair social order may soon change, even violently.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Hrishikesh Mukherjee
Cast: Amol Palekar, Utpal Dutt, Bindiya Goswami, Dina Pathak
Genre:Â comedy
Where it all started. At least two generations of Indians will count this as the best homegrown comedy ever made, and with good reason. Hrishikesh Mukherjeeâ€™s immensely well-crafted comedy of double identities has Ramprasad (Amol Palekar) doubling up as his non-existent twin brother and wearing a fake moustache, just to convince his new boss Bhavani (Utpal Dutt) that it wasnâ€™t him at a sports match. Throw in a couple of fake mums, the bossâ€™s daughter who is in love with the other â€˜brotherâ€™, a drunk Keshto Mukherjee and screenwriter Rahi Masoom Razaâ€™s memorable lines, and this is a comedy for all seasons.
The big sceneThe moment when Bhavani finally realises Ramprasadâ€™s lie while he is gorging on parathas approaches comedy nirvana.
Varun Grover
Director: Anurag Basu
Cast: Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra
Genre: adventure, comedy, romance
A success driven by word of mouth, â€˜Barfi!â€™ observes the magical relationship between an autistic woman, Jhilmil (Chopra), and a deaf-mute guy, Barfi (Kapoor). The film has the air of a fairytale, and Kapoorâ€™s twinkly-eyed, vividly expressive performance as the title character evokes Charlie Chaplin as well as his own grandfather, Raj Kapoor. â€˜Barfi!â€™ announced Kapoor as a credible actor and rising superstar rather than just a pretty boy. He is the fourth generation of the Kapoor family to star in Hindi movies.
The big sceneThe song â€˜Kyonâ€™ sees a gentle acoustic guitar accompany Barfiâ€™s attempts to move on from the fairytale world of the film. However, wherever Barfi turns, Jhilmil follows and as it dawns on him that sheâ€™s the one, the lush green landscape glows in approval.
Rahul Verma
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Rishi Kapoor, Padmini Kolhapure
Genre: drama
Raj Kapoor tackles the controversial subject of widows remarrying with this stark critique of old-fashioned family and tenancy structures, all framed within a big, commercial movie. Itâ€™s held together by teenage actress Padmini Kolhapure, who is utterly convincing and sympathetic as the unlucky bride who discovers the true meaning of love. There are rough edges to â€˜Prem Rogâ€™ and some hammy acting, but ultimately its liberal and progressive stance wins you over.
The big sceneA climax sees a widow who dared to love about to be executed by being burnt alive on a cross.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Hrishikesh Mukherjee
Cast: Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Johnny Walker
Genre: drama, tragedy, musical
Reigning superstar Rajesh Khanna plays the title character, whose days are numbered after heâ€™s diagnosed with cancer. The film explores his relationship with his doctor, Bhaskar, played by a young Amitabh Bachchan (who would famously oust Khanna from the box-office top spot a few years later). Anandâ€™s positive outlook on life and his playful demeanour is a lesson for those around him, even as Bhaskar, a more serious man, struggles with his inability to reverse Anandâ€™s medical condition. Apart from the performances, the film is memorable for Salil Chowdhuryâ€™s score.
The big sceneBhaskar cries over Anandâ€™s body, hysterically demanding that his dead friend speak again, when a voice recording left behind by Anand starts to playâ€¦
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Rekha
Genre: romance
Yash Chopraâ€™s most infamous film is based on the alleged real-life affair between Bollywoodâ€™s biggest star, Amitabh Bachchan, and the ultimate diva, actress Rekha. Outrageously, Bachchan persuaded his actress wife, Jaya, to come out of retirement to play his screen wife and his alleged mistress, Rekha, to act in this silly film as his screen mistress. Chopraâ€™s attempt to romanticise adultery via tuneful songs results in a somewhat sleazy film with a traditional cop-out ending. Today, itâ€™s regarded as a flawed cult classic due to its controversial casting and tuneful soundtrack.
The big sceneWhen real/reel wife and real/reel mistress meet in a highly-charged confrontational scene and both agree to fight for their man.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Zoya Akhtar
Cast: Hrithik Roshan, Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar
Genre: comedy, adventure, drama, road movie
Translated as â€˜You only live onceâ€™, this buddy-meets-mid-life-crisis movie sees three friends take a road trip in Spain: Arjun (Roshan) is a workaholic; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) wants to track down his biological father; and Kabir (Deol) is unsure about his upcoming wedding. â€˜Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaraâ€™ had a message for middle-class Indians living the new liberal dream with well-paid jobs: itâ€™s okay not to conform or to have a happily-ever-after romance.
The big sceneAs the friends do Pamplonaâ€™s bull run â€“ in slow motion â€“ thereâ€™s a voiceover of Akhtarâ€™s character, Imraan, reciting a poem about being free. The poem is written by Akhtarâ€™s screenwriter father, Javed (â€˜Sholayâ€™, â€˜Deewarâ€™). How meta is that?
Rahul Verma
Director: Ramesh Sippy
Cast: Amitabh Bachhan, Shashi Kapoor, Kulbhushan Kharbanda
Genre: action, comedy, thriller
Underrated excellence: Ramesh Sippyâ€™s follow-up to his career-defining â€˜Sholayâ€™ (1975) rode in on high expectations and left many viewers underwhelmed. But this story of two conmen (Bachhan and Kapoor) mending their ways and collaborating with a sharpshooter (Shatrughan Sinha) to avenge the death of their cop brother at the hands of the dreaded Shakaal (Kharbanda, in a stunning debut) has aged very well. The cons are very original and the scale of the film extravagantly ambitious.
The big sceneThe first image of Shakaal with his shiny, bald head and his punishment aquarium full of crocodiles and sharks sticks long in the memory.
Varun Grover
Director: Vidhu Vinod Chopra
Cast: Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar
Genre: crime, drama, romance
The quintessential Bollywood crime film, â€˜Parindaâ€™ tells of street-kid brothers Kishen (Shroff) and Karan (Kapoor). When Karan returns after completing his education abroad, he realises his brother has become a gangster working for Anna (Patekar). Boasting of some fine editing by the late Renu Saluja and stellar sound design, the film came to be known for director Vidhu Vinod Chopraâ€™s noir treatment, and all round brilliant acting.
The big sceneKaran meets his childhood buddy, police officer Prakash, at Kabutarkhana (pigeon house), where the latter is gunned down by Annaâ€™s henchmen. A shattered Karan is left holding his best friendâ€™s lifeless, bullet-ridden body.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Imtiaz Ali
Cast: Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Dara Singh
Genre: romance, musical, comedy
A winning second film from Imtiaz Ali, Jab We Met is the defining romantic comedy of a generation. Genuinely funny and heartwarming, it starts out as the classic story of the lost manchild, Aditya (Shahid Kapoor), encountering the female embodiment of joie de vivre, Geet (Kareena Kapoor), whose effervescent outlook changes his life. But before you can shout â€˜manic pixie dream girl!â€™, their roles are reversed, with Geetâ€™s heartbreak and subsequent descent into depression tended to by the newly go-getting Aditya. In effect, he must bring back to her the joy and zest she bequeathed to him.
The big scene: As Geet prepares to run away from home and reunite with her secret lover, Aditya asks her why sheâ€™s playing with her life like this. â€˜Because itâ€™s my favourite game!â€™ she replies.Â Sahir Avik Dâ€™souza
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Nadira, Nemo
Genre: drama, romance, musical
Lead actor and director Raj Kapoor modelled his on-screen persona in â€˜Shree 420â€™ and other films after Charlie Chaplinâ€™s Little Tramp. Here he plays Raj, who comes to Bombay to earn a living and falls in love with Vidya (Nargis). However, Rajâ€™s need to make quick money leads him to collaborate with corrupt businessman Dharmanand (Nemo) and his associate, the temptress Maya (Nadira). The film reflected a general state of unrest among unemployed youth and an increasing class divide in the country at the time.
The big sceneRaj is lured to a party by Maya (which means desire), with the song â€˜Mudh Mudh Ke Na Dekhâ€™ (â€˜Donâ€™t Look Backâ€™), as Vidya (which means education) cries outside the venue.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Farah Khan
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Rampal
Genre: satire, romance, musical
A runaway hit on release, â€˜Om Shanti Omâ€™ achieved what other similar films before it had tried and largely failed to do â€“ to satirise the idiosyncrasies of the Hindi film industry. â€˜Om Shanti Omâ€™ manages this while wearing the garb of a clichÃ©d reincarnation story. Om (Khan) is a junior artist in love with superstar Shanti (Padukone) in the 1970s. Shanti, though, is in love with a wily producer, Mukesh Mehra (Rampal), who has her killed. In the present day, Om is now a superstar out to exact revenge on Mehra, now settled in Hollywood.
The big sceneThe filmâ€™s climactic scene borrowed from Bimal Royâ€™s 1958 classic, â€˜Madhumatiâ€™, and sees Shantiâ€™s spirit return to help Om complete his revenge against Mehra.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Akshay Kumar
Genre: romance, musical
This musical romance and box-office hit explores the love lives of dancers in a musical troupe. Thereâ€™s Rahul (Khan), who does not understand how two people can fall in love. Pooja (Dixit) believes in the idea of soulmates and lives by the statement that â€˜someone, somewhere is made for youâ€™. Lastly, we have Nisha and her belief that love starts as friendship and two good friends have the potential to love one another right to the end. â€˜Dil To Pagal Haiâ€™ is remembered as one of the late Yash Chopraâ€™s best.
The big sceneRahul and Pooja finally confess their feelings for each other in front of a large audience in a climactic scene guaranteed to bring audiences to tears. After all, â€˜dil to pagal haiâ€™ (â€˜the heart is crazyâ€™), right?
Anushka Arora
Director: Raj Kapoor
Cast: Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Nargis
Genre: family courtroom drama
Known as The Show Man, Raj Kapoorâ€™s most famous film is a grand Oedipal melodrama exploring the nature-versus-nurture debate. Will a banditâ€™s son always end up a criminal? â€˜Awaraâ€™ explores class division in newly independent India, which excludes the filmâ€™s lowly â€˜trampâ€™ hero, Raj (Raj Kapoor), at every point. Its surprise success outside India â€“ especially in the USSR, Africa, China, Greece and the West Indies â€“ was directly responsible for introducing the world to mainstream Hindi cinema.
The big sceneThe nine-minute dance number, â€˜Ghar Aya Mera Pardesiâ€™ (â€˜My lover has come homeâ€™), sung by Lata Mangeshkar, is a dream sequence famous for its elaborate sets.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Rajkumar Santoshi
Cast: Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon
Genre: comedy, romance, musical
Rajkumar Santoshiâ€™s â€˜Andaz Apna Apnaâ€™ brought together two young, up-and-coming superstars, but the resulting film was a box-office failure. Its cult has grown over the years, spawning fan clubs and websites and ensuring record television ratings time after time. Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) are wastrels who both want to marry a rich heiress, but they become involved in a feud involving warring twin brothers and a buffoonish villain, Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor).
The big sceneThe filmâ€™s extended climax, during which all the characters fight over a bag of diamonds in a warehouse, boasts immense repeat value.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Farhan Akhtar
Cast: Aamir Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Saif Ali Khan
Genre: coming-of-age, drama, romance
Before the dawn of Indiaâ€™s urban multiplex culture in the mid-2000s, director Farhan Akhtar made his debut with this coming-of-age tale about three Mumbai boys whose language reflected how regular people talked â€“ a refreshing change from other Bollywood films of the time. Akhtar has never been able to better his first film, but with â€˜Dil Chahta Haiâ€™ he ushered in a style of storytelling that was new to Indian audiences, where everything from the dialogue and design to the music was subtle and realistic.
The big sceneDuring the song â€˜Tanhayeeâ€™, the Melbourne skyline whizzes by Aamir Khan, who is far from home and desolate after learning about the marriage of his lover to another man.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Ram Gopal Varma
Cast: JD Chakravarty, Urmila Matondkar, Manoj Bajpai
Genre: crime, drama, romance
â€˜Satyaâ€™ was among a slew of gangster films that hit screens in the late â€™90s, and director Ram Gopal Varma has lately come to be associated with the genre. The film tells of Satya (Chakravarty), who is unwittingly sucked into the world of Mumbai crime. What sets â€˜Satyaâ€™ apart from other gangster films is the realistic portrayal of the criminalsâ€™ daily lives and Varmaâ€™s unrestrained, gloomy treatment of the subject. Itâ€™s considered one of his best films.
The big sceneSatya pleads with his lover to open her door, while outside the police are trying to kill him. Thereâ€™s love and escape on one side of the door; violence and despair on the other.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Shekhar Kapur
Cast: Anil Kapoor, Sridevi, Amrish Puri
Genre: sci-fi, action, romcom
Shekhar â€˜Elizabethâ€™ Kapurâ€™s most famous Bollywood film. Arun (Kapoor) becomes the invisible superhero Mr India, who uses his power to fight the evil Mogambo (Puri) who is intent on taking over the world. Stuffed with as many masala ingredients as possible, this is pure camp nonsense. But itâ€™s told in such a cheeky kitsch way that the viewer surrenders to its sheer energy. â€˜Mr Indiaâ€™ is huge fun, especially Mogamboâ€™s catchphrase â€˜Mogambo Khush Huaâ€™ (â€˜Mogambo is happyâ€™) which became a national craze.
The big sceneThe â€˜Kaate Nahin Kat Teâ€™ song is regarded as perhaps the definitive sexy â€˜wet sariâ€™ song sequence in the history of Bollywood.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Mani Ratnam
Cast: Arvind Swamy, Manisha Koirala
Genre: romance, drama, tragedy
This poignant film covers one of the darkest periods in Indiaâ€™s contemporary history: the 1992 and 1993 Bombay riots. A love story about star-crossed lovers from different faiths who elope to Bombay to start a family, it proved so controversial on its release in 1995 that director Mani Ratnamâ€™s house was bombed by extremists. Nevertheless, its heart, moral centre and cry for peace in India resonated, and â€˜Mani Ratnamâ€™ became a critical and commercial success.
The big sceneâ€¨The sweeping love song â€˜Tu Hi Reâ€™, sung by Hariharan and Kavita Krishnamurthy â€“ and composed by AR Rahman, the man behind the music of â€˜Slumdog Millionaireâ€™ and â€˜127 Hoursâ€™ â€“ soundtracks a moment of pure passion between the filmâ€™s central couple. Itâ€™s widely considered to be one of Indian cinemaâ€™s most romantic scenes.
Ashanti Omkar
Director: Guru Dutt
Cast: Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Johnny Walker
Genre: drama, romance, tragedy
In a bizarre case of life imitating the movies, actor-director Guru Dutt died in an apartment in 1964 after allegedly consuming a concoction of sleeping pills and alcohol: his unsuccessful relationship with actor Waheeda Rehman was said to be one of the things that caused him to fall into depression. Six years earlier, Dutt made â€˜Kaagaz Ke Phoolâ€™, in which he played a director who falls in love with a film actress (played by Rehman). The film ended with Duttâ€™s character â€“ a dejected filmmaker â€“ dying in his chair at a film studio.
The big sceneThe song sequence â€˜Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitamâ€™, stunningly shot by cinematographer VK Murthy, sees Dutt and Rehmanâ€™s characters regretting the decisions theyâ€™ve made in life.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Rajkumar Hirani
Cast: Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor
Genre: Comedy, drama, family
â€˜3 Idiotsâ€™ charts the japes and scrapes of three students at Indiaâ€™s top engineering university (the film was shot in Bangalore). Along the way, this coming-of-age comedy addresses â€˜raggingâ€™ (initiation rituals), the intense pressure to excel in education, student suicide and the tension between the ambitions of students and their parents. â€˜3 Idiotsâ€™ was a huge hit and confirmed Aamir Khan as the master of balancing good old-fashioned family entertainment with meaningful messages.
The big sceneThe filmâ€™s catchphrase, â€˜All is wellâ€™, is still part of everyday language in India.
Rahul Verma
Director: Kundan Shah
Cast: Naseeruddin Shah, Ravi Baswani, Pankaj Kapur
Genre: satire, comedy, drama
Loosely inspired by Michelangelo Antonioniâ€™s 1966 film â€˜Blow-Upâ€™, â€˜Jaane Bhi Do Yaaroâ€™ (â€˜Who Pays the Piperâ€™) tells of two Mumbai photographers, Vinod (Shah) and Sudhir (Baswani), who unwittingly take a picture of a corrupt businessman (Kapur) killing a government official. The two discover the dead body and fight to ensure that it doesnâ€™t end up in the hands of a motley group â€“ the killer, his competitor, his two associates and a journalist, all of whom have vested interests in the case.
The big sceneThe epic climax, in which all the characters become part of a staging of Mahabharata, is widely considered to be the best comic scene ever shot in a Hindi film.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: SS Rajamouli
Cast: NT Rama Rao Jr, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody
Genre: action, drama
Believe it or not, this massive action extravaganza and even bigger box-office hit is actually based on two real-life historical figures during the British rule in India. Director SS Rajamouli does give their lives a fully fictionalised and highly bombastic skew, imbuing the men with superhuman powers, fighting against (and, for good measure, with) a myriad of CG animals, as well as the evil Brits, and throws in some musical bangers and some top-notch dance choreography for good measure. The story revolves around tribal leader Komaram Bheem (NT Rama Rao Jr), the protector of a village and its children, and his bromance with A Rama Raju (Ram Charan), a policeman with a hidden identity. They work together to save Malli, the daughter of Loki (not the God of Mischief, but a tribal Indian mum), who is forcefully taken from a forest as a trophy for a colonial wife and her brutal husband, the governor of the district. Cue, well, total mayhem.Â 
The big sceneJust when a colossal battle at the British colonial headquarters seems to have capped-out for explosions, fights and all-round chaos, someone turns up with a truck full of ferocious wild animals.Â 
Director: Manmohan Desai
Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor
Genre: drama, comedy, musical
The escapist formula honed by director Manmohan Desai (â€˜Dharam Veerâ€™, Rotiâ€™) peaked with this late 1970s film about three brothers â€“ each named in the title â€“ separated at birth. Brimming with clichÃ©s and implausible situations, â€˜Amar Akbar Anthonyâ€™ set the commercial template that many modern Bollywood filmmakers continue to follow. Thirty-five-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, the filmâ€™s star, defied his Angry Young Man image â€“ created by a string of sombre action dramas â€“ with his largely comical role.
The big sceneThe three characters enter a villainâ€™s den in disguise to rescue their respective loves, at the same time singing the filmâ€™s title track, each of their names signifying the religion in which each was raised â€“ Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Kamal Amrohi
Cast: Ashok Kumar, Meena Kumari, Raaj Kumar
Genre: historical romance
Lucknow, 1900. Sahibjaan (Kumari) is a â€˜dancing girlâ€™ who marries the respectable Salim (R Kumar), despite his dadâ€™s disapproval. Sahibjaan soon considers herself unworthy of her husband and runs away. Will the lovers be reunited and will â€˜respectable societyâ€™ accept them? Fifteen years in the making (not helped by personal differences between the director and his leading lady, also his wife), this has an evocative soundtrack which is weaved seamlessly into the story, creating perhaps the most magical, lyrical portrayal of idealised erotic romance seen on the Indian screen. The title means â€˜Pureâ€™.
The big sceneWhen Salim sees the exposed feet of the sleeping, covered Sahibjaan, he is immediately smitten.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Ashutosh Gowariker
Cast: Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh
Genre: adventure, drama, sport, historical
Set in the nineteenth century, â€˜Lagaanâ€™ sees a drought-struck village unite, learn to play cricket and take on their cruel imperial rulers. Although the combination of cricket and colonialism seems like a no-brainer in retrospect, at first nobody would touch this script with a bat. Then star Aamir Khan took the lead role and its critical and box office success ushered in a new era of alternative subject matter and varied storytelling. â€˜Lagaanâ€™ is, thus far, the last mainstream Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars.
The big sceneThe climactic cricket match saw audiences cheering on the villagers. The sports movie had arrived in Bollywood and â€˜Chak De! Indiaâ€™, â€˜Bhaag Milkha Bhaagâ€™ and â€˜Mary Komâ€™ later followed in the trailblazing wake of â€˜Lagaanâ€™.
Rahul Verma
Director: Yash Chopra
Cast: Shashi Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan, Neetu Singh
Genre: Action, thriller, crime
Evoking â€˜Mother Indiaâ€™ with its story of a good son pitched against a bad one and a mother caught between them, â€˜Deewaarâ€™ places an anti-hero centrestage. Amitabh Bachchan excels as the simmering Vijay, who turns to criminality to provide for his mum, while brother Ravi (Kapoor) becomes a cop. Inevitably, their paths must cross. â€˜Deewaarâ€™ was Bachchanâ€™s first step on the road to mega-stardom and it epitomises his status as the bristling, angry young man railing against all around him.
The big sceneInspector Ravi faces down gangster Vijay in his elder brotherâ€™s grand, ill-gotten house and declares that as long as Vijay is a criminal there is a â€˜deewaarâ€™ (wall) between them, and that their mum must choose between the two.
Rahul Verma
Director: Vijay Anand
Cast: Dev Anand, Waheeda Rehman, Leela Chitnis
Genre: romance, drama, musical
Director Vijay Anand adapts RK Narayanâ€™s English-language novel into a sprawling drama. â€˜Guideâ€™ tells of a man, Raju, who transforms from a tour guide in his youth into a great holy man later in life. The film is considered ahead of its time for showing its protagonists, Raju (Anand) and Rosie (Rehman), having an extra-marital affair, and also for presenting its lead character as an unscrupulous scumbag. Both were deeply unusual in a Hindi film of the time.
The big sceneRaju has an epiphany on his deathbed â€“ a spiritual awakening where he realises that even though the body dies, the soul will never fade away.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Guru Dutt
Cast: Guru Dutt, Mala Sinha, Waheeda Rehman
Genre: drama, romance, musical
Filmmaker Guru Dutt, known for bringing tragic stories to celluloid, plays Vijay, a struggling writer whose two best friends happen to be a streetwalker and a masseuse. Vijay tries unsuccessfully to get his book of poems published and is later believed to have died in a train accident. A cunning publisher prints the book and makes a killing. Maestro composer SD Burman provides a stellar soundtrack, memorable for Sahir Ludhianviâ€™s poetic verses. With â€˜Pyaasaâ€™, Dutt established himself as a filmmaker who could effectively depict the reality of the world around him.
The big sceneWhen Vijay â€˜returns from the deadâ€™ at his own memorial. Duttâ€™s silhouette, with the flash of light around him flooding the dark auditorium, sticks in the memory.
Aniruddha Guha
Director: Aditya Chopra
Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Amrish Puri
Genre: romance, comedy, family
Familiar themes of personal choice versus family responsibility, and of forbidden love, are remixed for the 1990s in this epic, era-defining romance. In London, Raj (Khan) is an immature young man, while straight-laced Simran (Kajol) is all set for a marriage arranged by her domineering father. She goes InterRailing in Europe, meets Raj and they fall in love against the backdrop of Swiss mountains. The popularity of the film (the title translates as â€˜The brave-hearted will take away the brideâ€™) is reflected in the fact that it has screened daily in Mumbaiâ€™s Maratha Mandir cinema for 19 years and counting. This ultimate romance also raised the bar impossibly high for guys chasing girls.
The big sceneThe hit song â€˜Tujhe Dekha Toâ€¦â€™ sees Simran and Raj reunited in Punjabâ€™s rolling fields, and its lingering gazes and passionate embraces are old school Bollywood at its finest. Rajâ€™s line â€“ â€˜Senorita bade bade desho me aisi choti choti baatein hoti rehtiâ€™ (â€˜Senorita, donâ€™t get stressed by the little thingsâ€™) â€“ has crossed into daily usage. Indeed, no less a figure than Barack Obama quoted it during his inaugural visit to India in 2015.
Rahul Verma
Director: Mehboob Khan
Cast: Nargis, Rajendra Kumar, Sunil Dutt
Genre: drama
The first Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign-Language Film at the Oscars, this is a heartbreaking story of the complexities of rural farming in newly independent India and the exploitation of farmers by their feudal landlords. It follows the hardships faced by Radha (Nargis), a village mother of three sons who is abandoned by her husband and forced to toil the paddy fields to survive. The film entrenched the idea of the pure, self-sacrificing mother figure as synonymous with the notion of an idealised Indian (Hindu) nation.
The big sceneWhen Radhaâ€™s rebellious son Birju (Dutt) shoots the lecherous evil landlord and kidnaps his daughter, she must take matters into her own hands to restore order.
Anil Sinanan
Director: K Asif
Cast: Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala
Genre: historical romance
Translated as â€˜Emperor of the Mughalsâ€™ and set in the late sixteenth century in Indiaâ€™s Mughal period, this is the doomed story of Prince Saleem (Kumar), son of the ruling Emperor Akbar (Kapoor), who falls in love with dancing slave girl Anarkali (Madhubala). This is true epic filmmaking, with magnificent sets, huge battle scenes with hundreds of real elephants, elaborate costumes, an evergreen score and naturalistic acting. It remains a gorgeous evocation of a bygone era, and was one of the rare occasions when a film of the â€˜Muslim socialâ€™ genre (i.e. interested in Muslim people and culture) became a blockbuster in Hindu-centric India.
The big sceneThis mostly black-and-white film suddenly bursts into colour when the classic â€˜I have loved, so what is there to fear?â€™ confrontational dance number begins.
Anil Sinanan
Director: Ramesh Sippy
Cast: Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Amjad Khan
Genre: action, thriller, western
This cult masala western sees escaped convicts Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Bachchan) defend a village terrorised by bandits led by the maniacal Gabbar Singh (Khan). â€˜Sholayâ€™ has it all â€“ epic dishum-dishum fight scenes, bromance, humour, memorable songs, plot twists, thrilling dance sequences and sparkling performances. The haunting score and Bollywoodâ€™s baddest villain are the icing on a rollicking, all-action cake.
The big sceneThree bandits return from a raid empty-handed to face Gabbarâ€™s ire: miraculously they survive trial by half-loaded gun (six chambers, three bullets) and Gabbar laughs hysterically. His men join in and thereâ€™s a collective relief-filled exhale â€“ then Gabbar shoots them anyway. The threat of a visit from Gabbar Singh has been used by parents to get kids to bed on time ever since.
